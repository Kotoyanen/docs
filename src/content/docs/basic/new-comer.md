[Kotoyanen](https://github.com/Kotoyanen) is a personally created organization to host a community-run platform.<br>
In Kotoyanen, users can create and share educational content in the form of quizzes and flashcards.<br>
Our goal is to make a open-source, community-driven learning platform.

The platform features the following:

- Users can create their own flashcards.
- Users can create their own quizzes, where each quiz is just a collection of flashcards.
    - Any publicly available flashcard can be added into the quiz, even if it's not your own.
- Users can comment and vote on flashcard/quizzes.
